# CVE-2020-16119

## Background
Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) is an unreliable, connection
oriented protocol designed to solve issues present in UDP and TCP, particularly
for real-time and multimedia (streaming) traffic.
It divides into a base protocol and pluggable congestion control
modules called CCIDs. Like pluggable TCP congestion control, at least one CCID
needs to be enabled in order for the protocol to function properly. In the Linux
implementation, this is the TCP-like CCID2. Additional CCIDs, such as
the TCP-friendly CCID3, are optional.

In recent months I have researched and reviewed various parts of the Linux kernel networking subsystem. In this time, I have come across a use-after-free vulnerability in the DCCP component of the latest kernel release (5.8.10).

## How Does the UAF Happen?
First, let's understand how the UAF occurrs in the first place. Here's a breakdown:

We create a socket with type ```SOCK_DCCP``` and protocol ```IPPROTO_IP```:
```c
socket(AF_INET6,SOCK_DCCP,IPPROTO_IP);
```
Then, we call ```listen()``` on the resulting socket. The socket object is now in the DCCP_LISTEN state.
Behind the scenes, when the socket is put in said state, ```dccp_create_openreq_child()``` is called:

```c
struct sock *dccp_create_openreq_child(struct sock *sk,
				       const struct request_sock *req,
				       const struct sk_buff *skb)
{
	struct sock *newsk = inet_csk_clone_lock(sk, req, GFP_ATOMIC);
	if (newsk != NULL) {
		struct dccp_request_sock *dreq = dccp_rsk(req);
		struct inet_connection_sock *newicsk = inet_csk(newsk);
		struct dccp_sock *newdp = dccp_sk(newsk);
		newdp->dccps_role	    = DCCP_ROLE_SERVER;
		newdp->dccps_hc_rx_ackvec   = NULL;
		newdp->dccps_service_list   = NULL;
    ...
}
```

We can see in ```dccp_create_openreq_child``` that the initial socket object is being cloned[1].
Note that when ```inet_csk_clone_lock()``` is called, dccps_hc_rx_ccid and dccps_hc_tx_ccid are copied.

If one of the socket objects is disconnected or closed, it
frees dccps_hc_rx_ccid/dccps_hc_tx_ccid and provides us a dangling pointer in the other socket object.

To make one of our socket objects disconnect, we can call ```connect()``` on it with AF_UNSPEC, and it will "free" our socket via ```dccp_disconnect()```.
```dccp_disconnect()``` sets the socket state to DCCP_CLOSED, and *doesn't* free and assign NULL to
dccps_hc_rx_ccid and dccps_hc_tx_ccid.

Then, we need to call ```connect()``` on a new socket with the same type and protocol as the first one.
After that, we call ```listen()``` on our new socket so our new socket object will get cloned with ```dccp_create_openreq_child()```.
```dccp_create_openreq_child()``` will create a new socket object thats holds the dangling pointers of dccps_hc_rx_ccid/dccps_hc_tx_ccid.
This leads to the old socket and the new socket holding the same pointers to dccps_hc_rx_ccid/dccps_hc_tx_ccid.

## Escalation to RCE
If we want to get arbitrary code execution with our dangling pointer (the freed object that we are using after we free ;D ), we have to dereference the dangling pointer 
with close/getsockopt. For example,

```ccid_hc_tx_delete``` is the function that is responsible for freeing dccps_hc_rx_ccid/dccps_hc_tx_ccid:

```c
void ccid_hc_tx_delete(struct ccid *ccid, struct sock *sk)
{
	if (ccid != NULL) {
		if (ccid->ccid_ops->ccid_hc_tx_exit != NULL)
			ccid->ccid_ops->ccid_hc_tx_exit(sk);      
		kmem_cache_free(ccid->ccid_ops->ccid_hc_tx_slab, ccid);
	}
}
```
 
We can see that this line: ```ccid->ccid_ops->ccid_hc_tx_exit(sk);``` is calling a function pointer.
When this function is called for the first time (when the ```connect()``` with AF_UNSPEC is called), it is harmless and simply does cleanup.
However, when it is called the second time (when we actually ```close()``` and control the dangling pointer), it can call an arbitrary address specified by us.

In order to exploit this and get IP control, we have to heap-spray the kernel.
